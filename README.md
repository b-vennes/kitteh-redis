# kitteh-redis

This project attempts to implement a functioning and relatively compliant Redis server using Cats Effect, Fs2, and Scodec.
As much as possible, the goal is to achieve a *realistic* implementation that is idiomatic, tested, and performant.
Unlike many other example project in the Cats ecosystem, this demonstrates a full *application* which achieves a non-trivial goal, and thus may be considered a starting point for general idioms and best-practices.
